## Day 1/100: Tuesday 12<sup>th</sup> March 2024
***Today's Progress:*** Went through normal string formatting and conditional string formatting. Also touched on string formatting using methods.

***Thoughts:*** Actually string formatting is kinda a broad topic. There are also very different ways of formatting strings in python.It all depends on your preference. I should also go through all ways so that it can be easier to read through some other person's code.
